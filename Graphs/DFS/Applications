Application Of Depth-First Search Algorithm
The minor spanning tree is produced by the DFS traversal of an unweighted graph.

Detecting a graph's cycle: A graph has a cycle if and only if a back edge is visible during DFS. As a result, you may run DFS on the graph to look for rear edges.

Topological Sorting: Topological Sorting is mainly used to schedule jobs based on the dependencies between them. 
In computer science, sorting arises in instruction scheduling, ordering formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis,
determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles, data serialization, and resolving symbols dependencies linkers.

To determine if a graph is bipartite: You can use either BFS or DFS to color a new vertex opposite its parents when you first discover it.
And check that each other edge does not connect two vertices of the same color. A connected component's first vertex can be either red or black.

Finding Strongly Connected Components in a Graph: A directed graph is strongly connected if each vertex in the graph has a path to every other vertex.

Solving mazes and other puzzles with only one solution:By only including nodes the current path in the visited set, DFS is used to locate all keys to a maze.

Path Finding: The DFS algorithm can be customized to discover a path   between two specified vertices, a and b.

Use s as the start vertex in DFS(G, s).
Keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex using a stack S.
Return the path as the contents of the stack as soon as destination vertex c is encountered.
